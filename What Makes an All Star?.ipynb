Of these, Cynthia Lee Fontaine was asked to return for a main season (season 9) and Nina West has only been eligible for one selection round and may be selected for subsequent seasons. This correlation makes a lot of sense in the context of the shows."

Some contestants, such as Trinity the Tuck, Shea Coulee, Valentina, and Ben Delacreme have stated that they turned down an earlier All Stars invitation in order to compete in a later season, while Phi Phi O'Hara allegedly turned down an All Stars Season 1 invitation due to scheduling conflicts. Kim Chi and Laganja Estranga have said that they have also turned down an All Stars invitation previously and did not appear in any subsequent All Stars seasons. Others have quit drag as a full-time career (Ivy Winters) or disavowed their drag personas entirely (Tyra Sanchez).\n",

Examples include Trixie Mattel (who had a country music career and successful web series outside the show and was selected for, and subsequently won, All Stars Season 3) and Jasmine Masters (who had a short run on the show but found success on YouTube and was selected for All Stars 4).\n",

Even after the Miss Congeniality award was voted by the other contestants, the winner was consistently a fan favourite regardless.\n",
